Usually you may encounter three level of impotence. Each level means a degree of congestion when it is fully erect:

1. Normal: as hard as a cucumber. So you know why sometimes you encounter a cucumber in some videos.
    * Corpus cavernosum has complete congestion.
    * The final size can be varied really greatly.
2. Slight impotence: as a banana. You can expect recovery in short term at this degree.
    * Corpus cavernosum has minor issue for congestion.
    * An operation is usually unnecessary.
    * Slight impact on sexual life.
    * Usually no impact on ability for reproduction.
3. Severe impotence: as a peeled banana. Impotence at this degree is unlikely to be cured soon.
    * Corpus cavernosum has severe issue for congestion.
    * An operation is usually required.
    * Severe impact on sexual life.
    * Usually actual impact on sperms activity.
4. Complete impotence: as jelly. It is really unlikely to be cured. And good luck buddy.
    * Corpus cavernosum can no longer storage blood.
    * Basically a sign for lost of ability for reproduction.

## Note !!!

All discussions above are based on the occasion that the lesion is loacted at your corpus cavernosum instead of blood pipes.
* If lesion is loacted at blood pipes, this kind of impotence will be quite easy to be cured.
