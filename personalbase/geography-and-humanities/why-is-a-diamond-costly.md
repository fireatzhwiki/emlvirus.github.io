## Why Is A Diamond Costly?

You should have witness the price tag on a 💎. The point is why it is costing an unblievable number of 💰?

## Relevant Concepts

Let's first go through some economy concepts:

* `value`: labor to manufacture the item, measured by average labor time.
* the very critical reason for `price` steady in a range (never increase or decrease infinitely) is `value` contained within.
* `price`: exemplification to `value`.
* `supply and demand`: a critical factor to cause oscillation of `price`.
* when `supply` is more than `demand`, price of an item will increase. On the contrary, it decreases.
* `law of value`: `value` is the fundamental reason to measure `price`; `price`, affected by `supply and demand`, oscillate around `value`.

## Analysis

Now, go back to the question: why is a 💎 costing 💰 in that amount?

* Is it very hard to be manufactured (required long time labor so containing great `value`)?

Indeed 💎 for jewelry is hard but a raw stone is **REALLY** easy. So this can be particially effect but not the very critical.

* Many people are eager to 💎 (causing great `demand`)?

Oh undoubtfully yes!

* But you need to realize this won't be an issue if `supply` is enough.

* Very rare (causing insufficient `supply` to `demand`)?

Not really on planet Earth.

* What is causing insufficient `supply`?

The control from manufacurers. The several major 💎 manufacurers form a union to control productivity globally so 💎 won't be too cheap.

## Conclusion

The reason that make a 💎 costing unbelievale amount of 💰:

1. great market `demand`
2. hardness for manufacture 💎 for jewelry from a raw stone
3. (the very critical one) productivity control from manufacurers
