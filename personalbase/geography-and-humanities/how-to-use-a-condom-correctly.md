## How To Use A Condom Correctly

Before you read any content below, there is a fact you need to keep in mind all the time:

> a condom **CAN NOT** garante you contraception for 100 percent

This is actually put onto all condom packages. You can expect to find it if you read carefully enough.
The noun `condom` means the male one specifically but it may refer a female one.

* Female condoms are unlikely to be used very often as they can't prevent pregnancy in many occasions. Here only male condoms are introduced unless I have specifically referred.

## Note !!!!

Here are things you need to notice to use a condom:

1. **DO NOT** wear a condom before it is fully erect
* The most severe consequence can be that the condom gets squeezed and left into her vagina.
2. Always wear a condom with **LEAST** folding as you can. See the consequence above.
3. As soon as you ejaculate, hold the opening of the condom with your thumb and the index finger steadily until pulled out. **DO NOT** take it off until you have totally pulled out.
* You need to realize sperms are actual living things so they can actually move (in the way of `swimming`).

NOTE: you can **NEVER** expect a 100-percent way to contraception by now.

Plus, I strongly recommend a condom (male or female) raher than contraceptives as the latter can be a real damage to female reproduction system.
