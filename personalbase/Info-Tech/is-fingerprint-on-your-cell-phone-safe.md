All cell phones manufactured in recent years are basically equipped with fingerprint device. The point is, does it **ACTUALLY** safe?

For **most of time**, unfortunately, **NO**.

## Details

Here are two mainstream types of fingerprint technology:

* `physical fingerprint`: essentially photo comparison

    * input thrice or more when register a new one to reduce rate of comparison error
    * unlikely to be affected by the dirty on finger
    * easily copied by simple devices

* `biology fingerprint`: complex algorithm about analysis to biology information containing in fingerprint
    * mostly done by only once
    * very likely to affected by the dirty
    * very unlikely to be copied by usual devices

On the very most devices there is `physical fingerprint` used instead of `biology fingerprint` becasue of cost of money.
