## Content Blockers Against Web Ecology

You may be really cheerful to the invention of content blocker as you enjoy it saving your time. But now, with the global abuse of content blockers, health of web ecology is gradually ruined, seconds by seconds, bits by bits.

## Concepts

Content blockers include but are not limited to the concept of ad blockers:

| | Content Blockers | Ad Blockers |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Package Types | Browser addons | Extensions or external executables |
| Contents Affected | Any Web content theoretically | Ads **ONLY** |
| Site Data Types Affected | Any sites types theoretically, including cookies | Ads scripts **ONLY** |
| Privacy Protection | Can be very helpful, depending on preferences | Minor mostly |
| Sites Usability | Can be severely broken, depending on preferences | Complete mostly |
| Web Ecology | No effect in some cases | Severe damage |
| Data Saved | Can be very obvious, depending on preferences | Depending on target sites |

## Effects

On the balance to benefit, we clearly see that content blockers head to users completely. You may feel this alright but just imagine such an occasion:

All goods on the market keep price reduction without any sign of stopping, you may feel happy at the very beginning. As time keeps going, all manufacturers and factories are forced to shut down by lack of in-coming. Now no one can buy things whatever s/he wants.

Same things are now happening between content blockers and web ecology.
