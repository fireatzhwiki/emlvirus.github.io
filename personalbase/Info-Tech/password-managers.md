## What are password managers?

Password managers are softwares that generate secure passwords and/or help you to keep them.

## Why do we need them?

Static text passwords have been know as liablity to online security. Currently, there is no better solution unfortunately. At users site, static text passwords should be as strong as possible. But once any of them is strong enough, it is unlikely to be remembered or generated by human brain. That's why password managers are introduced.

## What kinds of passwords are `strong` ?

You passwords strengh is measured by entropy bits (equivalent size of a random symmetric key, or, in human words, how random the password characters are) of the passwords text.   
    
    Do note that it is different from the concept of password length.  

The bit count can roughly be translated as follows:

| Entropy Bits | Passwords Strengh |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
| 0-64 | Very Weak |
| 64-80 | Weak |
| 80-112 | Moderate |
| 112-128 | Strong |
| ≥ 128 | Very strong |

## Are my passwords `safe` with password managers?

By the premise of non-existence of `definite security`, yes.

All mainstream password managers use AES standard to encrypt your entries. There is now no yet mathematical solution to AES and also unlikely to have any in predictable future as long as your private key is not leaked.

## Which password manager should I choose?

Here is a table about all mainstream password managers with features comparison among them:

### Additional Details

## LastPass

It has most features you can imagine as a password manager though a Windows client on desktop requires you to pay. This means you need $1 per month billed annually if you are to fill application passwords with LastPass. Secure sharing requires to pay as well.  
But it indeed deserves considering if you use a passowrd manager for yourself only and have few application passwords to fill out.

## Enpass

It is also a feature-riched passoword manager. All of its desktop clients are all free with free cloud sync through third-party service, like iCloud, Dropbox, OwnCloud, GoogleDrive, OneDrive & Box. The only thing is that all its moble clients charge $9.99 per license per device.

## 1Password

As a password manager without free service (at least $2.99 per month billed annually),
